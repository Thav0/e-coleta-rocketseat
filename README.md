## :rocket: About the project
<p>
This project is about a Small organic waste marketplace, establishing a connection between companies that collect organic / non-organic waste with people who need to dispose of this waste
</p>

<b>Main knowledge acquired in this project:</b>
- What is an APIRestful
  - If our API follows the REST patterns we have a RESTful api
- Typescript
  - Typescript is a superset, we can call it a language, it's a javascript with super powers
  - Why should we use typescript?
   - When working in a group, it helps us a lot to know what a particular function will receive or send, as it improves the editor's IntelliSense, allowing to determine the properties of some function or object
